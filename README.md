# Organiser
An android app aimed at tracking daily tasks, alarms and appointments

Please commit after every function is created or altered
Please push after you have finished coding for that day/session, and only push if it is working

Commit small, commit often

Keep functions/methods small, they should only do one thing. More methods are better than less
